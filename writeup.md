### 1. Complexity Analysis
1. LegislatorReportGenerator (generate_report):
  - Iterates over vote_results (V) → O(V)
  - Iterates over legislator_counts (L) → O(L)
**Total complexity: O(V + L)**
2. BillReportGenerator (generate_report):
  - Iterates over vote_results (V) → O(V)
  - Iterates over bill_counts (B) → O(B)
**Total complexity: O(V + B)**

Overall Complexity:
*LegislatorReportGenerator: O(V + L)*
*BillReportGenerator: O(V + B)*

Where:
V = number of votes, L = number of legislators, B = number of bills.

### 2. "How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?"
I think in this case I will change the DTO in my script and perhaps add another class for calculations (generating reports).

### 3. "How would you change your solution if instead of receiving CSVs of data, you were given a list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?"
For this purpose, I specifically considered the interface for reading certain types of data. Based on the `DataReader` class, we can create another class to work, for example, with the JSON format (in addition to the existing CSVReader). We can also go further and make similar adapter classes but for recording (so that we can record not only in CSV format).

### 4. "How long did you spend working on the assignment?"
Aroung 150 minutes.
